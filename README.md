# IPCC: discussing variables contribution and alternative scenarios


## Description

We use the Kaya identity and Shapley decomposition to shed light on the assumptions behind the IPCC's SSPs scenarios. After providing the marginal contribution of each Kaya variable for every scenario, we try to construct alternative scenarios based on the emergence of new pandemics and the recent global decline in fertility rates.

### SSPs scenarios
